const { app } = require('electron');

app.on('ready', () => {
  const isOnline = navigator.onLine;
  if (isOnline) {
    console.log('The app is currently online.');
  } else {
    console.log('The app is currently offline.');
  }
});



// In this example, we're using the app.on('ready', ...) event to run the code when the app is ready to start. We're then using the navigator.onLine property to determine whether the app is currently online or offline. We're logging a message to the console depending on the value of navigator.onLine.

// Note that navigator.onLine is not always reliable, as it can sometimes return true even if the user is not actually able to access the internet. Therefore, you may want to use additional methods to check for connectivity, such as trying to make a request to a known endpoint or using a library like ping.js
